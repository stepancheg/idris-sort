# Implementation of sort algorithm in Idris

Just for fun and self-education,

Most of code copy-pasted from [this beautiful blog post](https://github.com/bmsherman/blog/wiki/Quicksort-in-Idris).

Implementation of permutation transitivity
(which is the hardest part of the implementation, and omitted in "Quicksort in Idris" blogpost)
is taken from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/AndrasKovacs/0d7bcc3aba513c29ef73/).
